AppleTweet is an AppleScript wrapper for curl that invokes the Twitter API and integrates with Perceptive Automation's Indigo Home Automation software.

Its primary aim is to supplement Indigo's reporting capability with logging to Twitter in a semi-user-friendly manner. Secondarily, AppleTweet provides other functions that have come up in the process of Twitter-Logging from an Apple Mac Mini.
